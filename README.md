Fracture Network Evaluation Program (FraNEP): A software for analyzing trace-line maps of fracture networks: 
Computers & Geosciences, available online 31 May 2013. Doi: 10.1016/j.cageo.2013.04.027


This Excel Makro allows the analysis of trace-line maps of 2D fracture networks applying either: 
(a) the scanline sampling, 
(b) the window sampling, or 
(c) the circular scanline and window method.

The analysis includes:
- Evaluation of fracture length distributions applying power-law, negative exponential, or lognormal equations 
using the cumulative distribution function. 
The fracture lengths can be plotted as cumulative frequency of cumulative distribution
- Plot of fracture orientations in standard or length wieghted rose diagrams
- Typical fracture network parameters such as density, intensity, mean length
- Various options and correction methods.
